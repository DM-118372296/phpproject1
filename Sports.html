        I have played rugby for Muskerry Rugby Club since under 6s in 2005. 
              and have been an avid fan of both Munster and Ireland ever since. 
              I'm currently still playing with Muskerry who reside in Division 2 
              of the Munster Junior 1 League.

              I have also played both hurling and football with Whitechurch Gaa 
              since 2005 and I am still play with both junior Teams, and help
              out with the coaching of local underage teams in both codes.

              I represented my school team (SMGS Blarney) in hurling, football,
              soccer and rugby in my time there from 2012-2018.
